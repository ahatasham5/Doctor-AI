NB: its an amaizing data set, but the problem is, it is written in chinese. so i dont know i can use it

here i got an model which is fine tuned on this model, but the problem is, it use llama model. Today i have tried multiple time to execute llama 2 model but due to some unknow error my colab always crashed. so i have to return to gemini model. and because of that i am not using any model which is based on llama model.
